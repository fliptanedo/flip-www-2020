I am **not** currently taking Ph.D students. UCR undergraduates seeking mentoring in particle physics (e.g. through [NMC](https://www.aps.org/programs/minorities/nmc/) or [CL](https://www.cientificolatino.com)) may contact me to discuss the possibility. I work closely with the [UCR particle theory](https://theory.ucr.edu) group.

<small>Prospective UCR students should know that I am unlikely to take any student in the near future unless I have discussed this possibility ahead of time.</small>
